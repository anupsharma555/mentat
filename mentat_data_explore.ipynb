His mother reported that he had a breakup with his girlfriend a few weeks ago, and since then, he had been isolated in his room, sleeping most the day, not attending school, and eating one meal per day at most. On interview with the patient privately, he reported that he had been having worsening suicidal thoughts since the breakup and had been cutting himself with an Xacto knife blade that he found in the garage. He often thought about slitting his wrists when cutting and was unable to explain why he had not already attempted this. He refused to disclose where he had hidden the blade in his room and was unable to contract for safety. His mother reported that he had posted on social media that \"this won't matter soon anyway\". What would most psychiatrists do next in this situation?"

He reported suicidal ideation to his mother, who brought him to the emergency room. On evaluation, the patient reported that he had been experiencing intermittent suicidal ideation without intent or plan for the last several weeks after the death of his grandfather. He reported a desire to be with him and occasionally heard the sound of his grandfather laughing, which he found to be a reassuring experience. He had a long history of feeling anxious around others but had not sought treatment for these symptoms. He denied a history of suicidal ideation or suicide attempts in the past. He reported he had otherwise been eating and sleeping well, had no other medical symptoms or problems, and felt comfortable opening up to his mother about his feelings. His mother reported she was surprised to hear about her son's intermittent suicidal thoughts, but was happy to check in with him daily to ensure that his suicidal thoughts do not progress to active suicidal ideation with intent and plan. What else should the psychiatrist ask about when planning a disposition for this patient?"

       "**Q177:** A fifty-year-old male presents to a psychiatrist after referral from his primary care provider for mood concerns. On evaluation, he reports worsening mood, low energy, lack of pleasure or enjoyment in things he used to like to do, increased sleep, and irritability for the past two months. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia and is prescribed metoprolol and simvastatin. He has never experienced a depressed mood before and is typically a happy person. He is diagnosed with major depressive disorder, but he declines to start medication at this time and preferred to initiate therapy only. After two follow-up appointments over the course of the next two months, the psychiatrist learns that he has been resistant to treating his medical conditions with medications, but his husband was worried about his hypertension because he had a history of heart disease in his family. After some thought, the patient recalls that he started his metoprolol and simvastatin about two weeks before he started feeling sad. What is an accurate, succinct, and clinically appropriate way to document this information that is useful to a psychiatrist?"
