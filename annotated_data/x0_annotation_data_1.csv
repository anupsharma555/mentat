On evaluation, he runs to the psychiatrist and hugs him, and refuses to step away when asked. He continued to touch and hug the psychiatrist throughout the interview. His mother noted that he has always been this way, and that she often has worried that he would run off with a stranger. During the evaluation, his adoptive mother reported that he has a history of significant physical and emotional neglect from birth to six months from his biological parents, and was placed in foster care at six months with her. She adopted him at age 1.5, but had to give up custody to another family for about six months when he was 2 due to a significant medical illness. He was placed back with her at age 3 and adopted at age 4. She brought him to a psychiatrist due to concerns about anger outbursts and hyperactivity at home.

She disclosed suicidal ideation to her school counselor, who contacted her parents. On evaluation with the psychiatrist, the patient reported worsening mood for the last several years, significant anxiety, and three previous suicide attempts that she had not disclosed prior, including one suicide attempt a week ago in which she held her father's gun up to her forehead, then put it away after thinking about her dog. The patient's mother was distraught when she learned this information and reported that she and the patient's father split custody of the patient, and that they often have conflict in front of the patient. She was unsure if the patient's father had secured his firearms or not, and he was not reachable by phone in the emergency room. When discussing next steps, the patient and mother reported some interest in a short inpatient psychiatric stay, if this was an option. The patient was not linked to therapy or psychiatry. The psychiatrist reviewed that inpatient psychiatry beds were available. The mother reported that she was willing to safetyproof her home, and the patient was not able to consistently report that she would not attempt suicide on discharge home.
