On evaluation, her parents report that she was adopted at four months. Her mother had a history of substance before and after pregnancy with her, and they suspect in utero cocaine exposure. They deny a specific history of trauma. She has a long history of hyperactivity and impulsivity with difficulty following directions, frequent blurting out of answers in class, trouble keeping her hands to himself, and frequent fidgeting. She also has a history of anxiety, particularly around other people. She reports frequently thinking about her family of origin. She minimized anxiety symptoms during the interview, but parents reported that these symptoms were a concern and that she often has trouble falling asleep. Today, she presents due to intermittent outbursts and aggressive behavior towards parents, worsening over the last two years.
