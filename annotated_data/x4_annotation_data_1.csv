On evaluation, he reports worsening mood, low energy, lack of pleasure or enjoyment in things he used to like to do, increased sleep, and irritability for the past two months. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia and is prescribed metoprolol and simvastatin. He has never experienced a depressed mood before and is typically a happy person. He is diagnosed with major depressive disorder, but he declines to start medication at this time and preferred to initiate therapy only. After two follow-up appointments over the course of the next two months, the psychiatrist learns that he has been resistant to treating his medical conditions with medications, but his husband was worried about his hypertension because he had a history of heart disease in his family. After some thought, the patient recalls that he started his metoprolol and simvastatin about two weeks before he started feeling sad. What is an accurate, succinct, and clinically appropriate way to document this information that is useful to a psychiatrist?","q_male"
