He has a history of type 1 diabetes and partial paraplegia related to a spinal-cord injury 1 year ago.

He is often tearful and feels like life is meaningless now. He thinks about ending his suffering on a daily basis via stopping to administer his insulin. You ask if he would be able to tell his family or present to an emergency room if his suicidal thoughts worsened and he tearfully replies 'I don't know'.

You speak with his husband on the phone who states that he has stopped administering his insulin over the past few days and talks about ending his life on a daily basis.
