On evaluation, he reports recurrent and persistent worries that he is going to run over one of his children when he backs his car out of the driveway. He spends about 1 hour checking that the driveway is clear and that his children are a safe distance from the car when he leaves the house. He has started becoming late for work due to his routine, and this is interfering in his relationship with his supervisor and his wife. He came to the psychiatrist because he is not sure what else to do, and his primary care doctor suggested it. He has a history of similar, recurrent fears that he would hurt someone when driving, but it has never interfered with his life in this way before and got worse once his youngest son started walking.
