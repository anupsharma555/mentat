She has a history of physical abuse from her father and has noted that 'if I break the rules, I get the belt.' Previous instances of physical abuse have been reported to Child Protective Services, with some break in rapport with parents when these reports have been made. She reports that she uses cannabis to deal with her anxiety, and worries about what will happen if her father finds out. What is an accurate, succinct, and clinically appropriate way to document this information that is useful to a psychiatrist?","q_female"
