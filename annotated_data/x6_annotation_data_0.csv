Their medical team has consulted psychiatry as they have been asking bizarre questions and does not seem to understand their medical treatment. On evaluation, the patient states that they don't need to take antibiotics because they are Jesus and can heal themself. You call this patient's mother who states that the patient has recently been wandering the streets of their neighborhood at night and talking to themself. She also states that the patient's brother has been diagnosed with schizophrenia. The consult psychiatrist decides to start an antipsychotic medication and the medical team continues to treat their infection until they are transitioned to oral antibiotics and ready to discharge medically. At this point, the patient has agreed to take their oral antibiotics, but is still noted to be speaking to themself and thinks that they are Jesus. How would most consultation psychiatrists triage this situation?","q_they"
