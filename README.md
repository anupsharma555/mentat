# MENTAT: Clinician-Annotated Dataset of Real-World Tasks and Ambiguity in Mental Healthcare

_MENtal health Tasks AssessmenT_ dataset (named as a nod to the profession in Frank Herbert’s *Dune* and the intelligence-boosting items in *Fallout*). 

## Project Summary

**MENTAT** is a clinician-annotated dataset designed to capture the nuances of real-world decision-making in mental healthcare. Unlike traditional medical exam-style benchmarks that emphasize fact recall, MENTAT focuses on five critical domains of mental health practice—diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, triage, and documentation. The dataset is curated entirely by mental health experts without the influence of language model assistance, ensuring that it accurately reflects the inherent ambiguities of clinical decision-making. For more detailed information, please refer to our [arXiv page](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16051).

## Feedback and Support

We are eager to hear from users! If you are using MENTAT and encounter issues with the code or data quality, please reach out to us. Your feedback is invaluable for improving the dataset and ensuring it meets the needs of the mental healthcare and research community. Feel free to open an issue on our GitHub repository or contact the authors directly.

## Getting Started

*(02/27/25) We are currently finalizing the data for release and will upload the raw annotation data and the processed dataset with labels shortly. Reasons for delay: Anonymization checks and web scraping protection.*
